/**
 *  A default implementation mouse listener that provides default
 *  implementations for all MouseListener methods.  In addition,
 *  the mouseButtonEvent() provides basic default click behavior
 *  calling an overridable click() method.  Default click detection
 *  uses a pixel-based threshold that can be specified on the constructor
 *  and is implemented with the overridable isClick() method.
